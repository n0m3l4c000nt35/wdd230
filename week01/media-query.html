      <h2>Omni 1:2</h2>
      <p>Wherefore, in my days, I would that ye should know that I fought much with the sword to preserve my people, the
        Nephites, from falling into the hands of their enemies, the Lamanites. But behold, I of myself am a wicked man,
        and I
        have not kept the statutes and the commandments of the Lord as I ought to have done.</p>

      <h2>Mormon 8:5</h2>
      <p>Behold, my father hath made this record, and he hath written the intent thereof. And behold, I would write it
        also if I
        had room upon the plates, but I have not; and ore I have none, for I am alone. My father hath been slain in
        battle, and
        all my kinsfolk, and I have not friends nor whither to go; and how long the Lord will suffer that I may live I
        know not.</p>
